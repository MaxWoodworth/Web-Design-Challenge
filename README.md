Creates Repository for HTML Assignment
#Comments on Assignment
I had previously taken a course on html at Indiana University several years back and this was such a much more indepth assignment and unit than we ever got in the entire semester. I really enjoyed this one. I noticed that when I found an issue on one page it was frustrating at times to go through and fix it on all the pages. That being said it showed me the emphasis of making sure everything is squared away with the formatting of the pages before moving forward with the finer details.

#Things I would Like to go back and work more on.
First I would like to go back and make it a little more visually appealling when I have more time. Second I would like to create links to pages for the images on the comparison page or maybe rahter a link to a specific data table for that graph when clicked.
